#  What is Python?

# Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum released in 1991.

# widely used in web development, data science, automation, AI, and web scrapping, testing.


# Features of Python

#  Simple and Easy to Learn
#  Interpreted Language
#  Platform Independent
#  Open Source & Freeware
#  Rich set of modules
#  Object-Oriented
#  Dynamic language
#  Portability


# Python Setup & Installation

# Go to official websites: https://www.python.org and Download latest version.
# after downloading click “Install Now”
# In Command Prompt ---> python --version to confirm python installed successfully with current version


# Variable?
# A variable is a name that stores data or a value, it acts like a container to hold information that can be used and changed later.
# Create a Variable
# x = 10
# name = "Alice"
# No need to declare type (Python automatically detects it is showing the dynamic nature).

# naming convention
# Must start with (A-Z or a-z) or (_), cannot start with a number, can contain letters, numbers, and underscores only no other characters



#  Data types- define what is the type of the data(value stored in variable)
# Types
# 1. Numeric Types - to store numbers
# 2. Sequence Types - to store collections of items in a specific order
# 3. Set Types - to store unordered collections of  items
# 4. Mapping Type- to store data in key-value pairs
# 5. Boolean Type - to store True or False
# 6. None Type - holds nothing(null)

# type() to check data type
# type(10)         # <class 'int'>
# type("hello")    # <class 'str'>

# Type Casting:
# float(10)        # Converts int to float
# int(12.3)        # Converts float to number


# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# 1. Arithmetic Operators -> for basic mathematical operations.  	
# +(Addition)	
# -(Subtraction)
# *(Multiplication)	
# /(Division)	
# %(Modulus)
# **(Exponentiation)
# //(Floor Division)
	
# 2. Assignment Operators -> to assign values to variables.
# =, +=, -=, *=, /=

# 3. Comparison Operators ->to compare values. Returns True or False.
# Equal to 
# != Not equal to 
# > Greater than 
# < Less than 
# >= Greater than or equal to 
# <= Less than or equal to 

# 4. Logical Operators ->to combine conditional statements.
# and, or, not
# 5. Identity Operators ->Check if two variables refer to the same object in memory.
# is, is not
# 6. Membership Operators -> Check whether a value is present in a sequence (like list, string, tuple).
# in, not in
# 7. Bitwise Operators -> Perform bit-level operations.
# &,|,^,~,<<,>>
